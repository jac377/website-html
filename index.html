        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I am Juan Cuevas, and I am a current Mechanical Engineer student at Brigham Young University.
          I am currently taking a web programming class, which is teaching me great tools that can connect
          me with the world. Through this website, I will not only be able to showcase what I have accomplished in
          this class, but I would like to show who I am as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am from Argentina, and I came to the USA with the purpose to study English. However, as I met with my
          classmates and friends, they inspired me to stay and study Mechanical Engineering. After my first year of
          of school, I met my wife, and we are very happy together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to work with airplanes, since it has been one of my childhood hobbies. Also, I like Formula 1
          and many other racing categories. Lastly, I recently got into rocketry, and I was able to achieve my
          level 1 certification <b>See Fig. 1</b>. I was able to reach around 1000
          from the ground, and it recovery was amazing&excl; Currently, I am working on my level 2 rocket. The 
          goal is to reach 5000 ft.

        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to gain experience between different techonolgies, and how we could
          implement them. For example, we learned how to build the structure using HTML, and then CSS to give
          the website style and desing. Click <a href="https://simon.mindlydrinking.click">here</a> to navigate
