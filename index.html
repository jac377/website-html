        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I am Juan Cuevas, and I am a current Mechanical Engineer student at Brigham Young University.
          I am currently taking a web programming class, which is teaching me great tools that can connect
          me with the world. Through this website, I will not only be able to showcase what I have accomplished in
          this class, but I would like to show who I am as well.

          I am from Argentina, and I came to the USA with the purpose to study English. However, as I met with my
          classmates and friends, they inspired me to stay and study Mechanical Engineering. After my first year of
          of school, I met my wife, and we are very happy together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to work with airplanes, since it has been one of my childhood hobbies. Also, I like Formula 1
          and many other racing categories. Lastly, I recently got into rocketry, and I was able to achieve my
          level 1 certification <b>See the picture below of me and my JAC-1</b>. I was able to reach around 1000
          from the ground, and it recovery was amazing&excl;Currently, I am working on my level 2 rocket. The 
          goal is to reach 5000 ft.
